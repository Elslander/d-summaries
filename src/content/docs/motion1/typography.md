## Text Layers

In After Effecs, Text Layers are special layers specifically designed for adding and editing text in your commposition. They function as standalone elements in your project, similar to other layers like images or videos, but offer extensive text-specific features and animation options.

With a Text Layer, you can type and style text within After Effects, much like in a work processor. You can adjust the font, size, color, alignment, and formatting of the text. This is all done through the **Character** and **Paragraph** panels.

You can create a text later via `Layer > New > Text Layer` or by using the Horizontal Type Tool (cmd + T) in the toolbar.

The Source Text of a Text Layer in After Effects is the property that determines the content of the text in the layer. This means that the Source Text contains the actual text string (the letters, words, or sentences) that you see in the Text Layer and is displayed in the composition.<br />
Tip: You can use multiple fonts and styles within a single Text Layer.

**Text Layers** are inheritently continuous layers: they automatically adjust to the length of the text and expand horizontally as you type more. They aren't restricted by a specific box size and remain flexible in width. These are the general text layers you create when you click on a blank screen with the Horizontal Type Tool (cmd + t) to draw a rectangular frame.

## Text animation

Text animation can be done with animators and selectors by following these steps:

1. Add a specific animator that youb want to animate via the Animate button.
2. Use a selector to control how much each character is affected.
3. Adjust the properties to achieve the desired animation.

## Position Text on a Mask

You can position text along a path, allowing you to place text in a circular shape or along a zigzag line, for example. Follow these steps:

1. Select the text layer and use the **Pen Tool** or **Shape Tool** to draw a mask.
2. In the Timeline panel, open **Path Options** and choose the mask you just created.
3. To adjust the position of the text on the path, you can modify the First Margin and Last Margin properties.

## Template effects

After Effects provides a set of predefined text effects, saving you a lot of time. Check these out before creating a custom effect or use them as a starting point to get started quickly. You can find these presets in the Effects & Presets panel (Window > Effects & Presets) under Animation Presets > Text.

In the panel's menu, you can preview these presets in advance by choosing "Browse Presets" (make sure Adobe Bridge is installed). When you use an animation preset, you'll see that the structure is similar to how we previously built our own animations, making them interesting to analyse and learn from.
