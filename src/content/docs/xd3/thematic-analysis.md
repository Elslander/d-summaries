## Qualitative research analytics

To find patterns and themes in **information chaos** that represent the most **interesting aspects** of your data and that you can use for a basis for **personas, user scenarios and design choices**.

### Criteria

- **Durability**: If the research would be repeated > it would lead to similar results. The road to the result is transparent and well documented.
- **Credibility**: The research results are recognisable for the participants or target audience.

### Is it subjective

You, as a researcher are an essential part of the result. It is **you who reflects on the data**. It is you, as a researcher, that sees the patterns and formulates insights. **Your subjectivity is part of the analysis**.

- A critical attitude is essential: let your work be read by peers. Take a step back at moments to reflect.
- Reflect back to your main research question often during the process. Are you still answering the question?
- Do the same in quantitative research.

### The process: 6 steps

#### Step 1: Get to know your data

Read carefully through your whole data (e.g. interviews). Use colours to highlight elements that stand out.

Ask yourself these questions:

- **Why?**
  - Why did they say or do this?
- **What?**
  - What did they mean by this?
  - What do I think this means?

Go through the data a second time and do the following:

- divide up into fragments
- no good or bad
- colouring keywords or summarise

If you do this for different types of data, keep them separate.

There are two approaches:

- Inductive
  - You keep an **open mindset**, all information is welcome.
  - Let the data speak
- Deductive
  - Analyse with a **diraction in mind** > often to test theories, models or ideas.
  - You select fragments on specific concepts.

#### Step 2: Give codes to the data

Go through your data and notes, and give '**codes**' to the data:

- code = 1-3 (5) words
- The sama data can have different codes

Keep in mind:

- In Vevo
  - keywords from the fragments
- Latent
  - in your own words
  - use a summary step in between
- Non Verbal
  - facial and body expressions
  - exclamations

Approach this in three steps:

- Tentative coding
  - clear
  - unique
  - code
  - use a summary or keyword as a step in between
- Relevant coding
  - What codes are relevant for the research question?
  - Start grouping related codes together.
- Unique coding
  - Remove the overlap
  - Combine codes. When in doubt, review the excerpt or the new code to determine whether it still reflects the essence. If not, retain the innitial code.

#### Step 3: Search for themes

These are the topics that were mentioned the most. You find them by clustering codes.  
Themes can be related to each other.

#### Step 4: Review themes

- Are the clusters ok?
- Is the context of the clusters still correct?
- You can check back on the selected fragment if you need to see the details behind a code.
- Are they overarching themes?
- What is more important? Fiend hierarchy in your results.

> **Incubation**  
> = time, rest and calmness helps to 'see' it better  
> = period of rest in which you come to new ideas (e.g. shower, car)

#### Step 5: Define names (conceptualisation)

This is more than just determining the name of the theme.

Gather the information beneath each theme.

- Collect the codes
- Read through the connected fragments if needed

Describe in **your own words** what the **findings** are beneath each theme.

##### What if?

**What if just more answers than questions come up after your thematic analysis?**  
That's just fine! Through good analysis, you always come across new avenues, new areas of knowledge.

**What if there is too much data?**  
Then you take out what is most important.

#### Step 6: Produce the report and present

Depending on the audience for your report, use different techniques.

In Devine we want you to present your data in a visual creative way.

Findings could end up in quotes, personas, user stories, data visualisations,...

### Thematic Analysis (powered by AI)

Since last year research are exploring how to let AI do the hard work of qualitative research and generate codes and themes with for example ChatGPT.

There is a 6 step process:

- Discovery Phase
  - Familiarisation
- Reduction Phase
  - Selection of Quotations + Selection of Keywords + Codes
  - Group codes into Themes
- Reflection Phase
  - Find connections between themes and the research
  - Create your own insights

#### Step 1: Get AI familiarised with the research method and question

Prompt:

```txt
This research analyses primary data to achieve the research aim by answering the following research question.
This study follows the qualitative research method.
Research aim & objectives: [Paste the research aim, objective]
Research question: [Paste the main research question (and optionally information on the research problem].
```

Question you can ask to be sure:

```txt
Please state the guiding principles of qualitative research (by Naeem) and the steps needed for this.
```

#### Step 2: Select fragments and develop codes

Prompt for analysing data:

```txt
We will be doing the first step of thematic analysis (framework from Naeem) and create codes for fragments of
the text.
First I will upload each transcript of interviews separately.
I want you to develop an initial/open coding framework. After each uploaded transcript you will list the fragments
you selected. With this you list the keywords taken from the fragment and the chosen code. Please make sure that
the keywords taken from the fragments reflect the participants’ points of view and insights to directly answer the
research question and understand the research phenomenon under study.
Please organise this in a table: fragment / keywords / codes
Are these instructions clear?"
```

Prompt for developing codes:

```txt
Create a list of all created codes.
```

#### Step 3: Group codes into themes

Prompt:

```txt
Group codes from this list together and use a theme to describe the group. This theme is descriptive and topical.
Do not change the meaning or the wording of the codes.
How can you group? If codes have similar topics, group these codes together.The goal is to use all codes
generated. Codes can be part of more groups if they relate to more than 1 theme..
Set this up in a coding table. Group, theme / Codes
```

#### Step 4: Connect themes to the research

Prompt:

```txt
This is the research question: [insert your research question ]
These are the subquestions [insert sub questions]
From the table of codes and themes, develop a thematic framework that could answer these questions. Use
understanding of the primary data given and the codes and themes to answer these questions. You can merge
codes if they have similar meaning. You can combine codes if they have simulas meaning. As long as they stay
connected to the topics in the data given.
Suggest the thematic framework.
```

Ask to connect, in a table, the themes and subthemes to the specific quotes from the first step.

This way you can check if the analysis was correct and have your quotes ready to support your findings.

#### Step 5: Create your own insights

Read it yourself. Check back when in doubt from where it came from.

Think on the suggested themes framework.

What do you learn from it?

### Thematic Analysis: Rainbow spreadsheet

An **observation sheet**, repeated observations are highlighted in different colours.

### Thematic Analysis: Segmentation analysis - Dimension analysis

Split the attributes into smaller ones.

### Thematic Analysis: Card sorting

First search for codes/cards and then prioritise those cards. 

Good method to do with customers.

### Thematic Analysis: Turf/Counting and prioritising

First search for codes/cards and then prioritise those cards. 

### Thematic Analysis: Summary

**When?**  
When processing large pieces of (qualitative) data.

**What?**  
Coding and clustering to common themes.

**Takeaway**  
In Thematic Analysis you are going to reanalyse your data a lot, but slightly different.
