Interviews are **qualitative**:

- Understand how people use a product, why, what they feel about it = user experience.
- Ask questions and record answers (cheap and easy).

## 1. Types of user interviews

### One-on-One

- Interviewer and person
- Good for specific details, you can ask more questions
- Good for insights about individual users

### In group

- Interviewer and several persons
- Can be in interview form or workshop
- Good for group discussion
- Good for sharing and confirming each other's challenges

### User interview

- A researcher or designer talks directly to the people who use a product
- topics like: the subject's background, occupation, goals, how they use the product, motivaitons, and pain points

### Field study

- Interviewing a user in their context instead of yours. (eg. in their home instead of at your office)

## 2. Prepare your interview

### Practical stuff

- How many people should you interview to have a big and plausible enough audience?
- What do you need to consider when you are looking for a good set of participants?
- When do you need to start looking for people for your interviews?
- Where should you interview people?
- How long does an interview take?
- What do you think of when you hear 'Role assignment or tag teaming'?
- What is the crucial part you should NOT do when taking notes during the interview?

### Reaching out to your audience

### Prepare questionnaire

- What do you want to find out about your target audience?
- which questions came out of your PSD and UGD?

#### Asking for permissions

**Informed consent**: Document about distribution, privacy, trust in the research.

Ethical duty to ensure that your user research does not harm the people who participate them.

Informed consent does not equal NDA (non-disclosure-agreement).

### Prepare your questions

- **Brainstorm** about the questions you want to ask.
- **Group** your questions into themes.
- Put them in a logical **order** so that the 'conversation' can proceed SMOOTHLY.
  - More difficult and intensive questions in the middle.
  - Themes that build on each other, put them after each other.
- **Final check**:
  - Reread and refine, be critical.
  - Remove repeated or similar questions.
  - Merge questions or split them up.
- And think of questions which you can tap into the **emotions** of the person.

### Some themes you can ask about

- Background info
- Digital literacy, use of technology (not literally but incorporated into your questions).
- Use of product / service
- The goal and motivations of the person.
- The pain points and struggles of the person.

### Types of questions

1. Open or closed questions
2. Understanding user tasks / activities
3. Performing / showing
4. Recalling the past / anticipating the future
5. Opinions / points of view / attitude and projections
6. Talking about problems and pain points
7. Complete or draw a sentence

### Checklist (also for surveys)

  - introduction
  - opening questions
  - transitional questions
  - key questions
  - (creative exercise)

## Conducting the interview

### How to interview? (have a conversation)

- Be human
- Seek stories
- Talk about feelings

1. Introduce yourself
2. Intro project
3. Build rapport
4. Evoke stories and emotions
5. Follow-up and reflections

### During the interview

- Use a **script**. You can/may deviate from this if necessary.
- allow some **time between** interviews to process notes.
- Keep an eye on the time and keep the **right direction**.
- Make your interviewers **comfortable**.
- **Focus** on the interviewer and not on taking notes.
- **Thank** the interviewer at the end.

**T**: Talk me through... / Tell me ...<br />
**E**: Explain...<br />

## Results of your interviews

### Transcribing your interviews

- Write out an interview.
- Use speech to text.

### Pitfalls

1. Telling what you **would do**. is not the same as what you **effectively do**.
2. Memory of humans is limited. You try to remember details but they are vague so you tell a story that is **wishful** instead of **actual**.
3. **Users are not designers**. Stick to the topic, purely the questioning and how the user feels.
